RealDiag release manifest
Release: v1.0.12
Date: 2025-11-05

This file lists images and their resolved digests that were observed when deploying
`k8s/staging-realdiag.yaml` into the `staging` namespace on the user's kind cluster.

Images (tag and digest):

- ghcr.io/bevroy/realdiag-api:v1.0.12@sha256:cf683e8e5835a347fd498674b7840141bc70d692796e64f7bad978aa2690d0b4
- ghcr.io/bevroy/realdiag-web:v1.0.12@sha256:b4ce40c6ee11bf41d32fe118756f8e5fcf0430d719508e15d1a6e106976af88e

Notes:
- Manifest applied from `k8s/staging-realdiag.yaml`.
- `staging` namespace was created in the target cluster and deployments were rolled out.
- An imagePullSecret named `ghcr-pull-secret` exists in the `staging` namespace and
  the default ServiceAccount was patched to reference it so pods can pull private
  GHCR images.

How to verify locally (commands run during deployment):

export KUBECONFIG=/workspaces/RealDiag-Software/.kube/config
kubectl -n staging get pods -o wide
kubectl -n staging describe pod <pod-name>
kubectl -n staging logs -l app=realdiag-api --tail=200
kubectl -n staging logs -l app=realdiag-web --tail=200

If you'd like, I can attach this file to the existing GitHub Release `v1.0.12` as an
artifact; to do that I need a GitHub token with repo rights or `gh` CLI authentication
in this environment. Alternatively you can download this file from the repo once
it's pushed and attach it to the release manually.
