  - id: GER-DELIRIUM
    label: Delirium (Acute Confusional State)
    presentations:
      - Acute change in mental status (hours to days, not weeks/months like dementia)
      - Fluctuating level of consciousness (waxes and wanes throughout day)
      - Inattention: Inability to focus, easily distracted, trouble tracking conversation
      - Disorganized thinking: Rambling, illogical, tangential speech
      - Altered level of consciousness: Hyperalert (hyperactive) or lethargic (hypoactive)
      - Perceptual disturbances: Visual hallucinations, delusions
      - Hypoactive delirium (most common in elderly): Withdrawn, quiet, easily missed
      - Often reversible if underlying cause treated
    clinical_pearls:
      - "CAM criteria (Confusion Assessment Method): (1) Acute onset + fluctuating AND (2) Inattention AND (3) Disorganized thinking OR (4) Altered LOC"
      - "Hyperactive (25%): Agitated, restless, hallucinations - easily recognized"
      - "Hypoactive (50%): Lethargic, withdrawn, quiet - often MISSED, higher mortality"
      - "Mixed (25%): Alternates between hyperactive and hypoactive"
      - "Common causes: Infection (UTI, pneumonia), medications (anticholinergics, benzos, opioids), metabolic (hyponatremia, hypoglycemia), hypoxia, pain"
      - "Do NOT treat with antipsychotics first: Find and treat underlying cause, use non-pharm interventions"
    management:
      - "Workup: Infection screen (UA, CXR, blood cultures), metabolics (BMP, Ca, glucose), medication review, ECG, consider CT head"
      - "Identify and treat cause: Antibiotics for infection, stop offending meds, correct metabolic abnormalities"
      - "Non-pharmacologic: Reorient frequently, familiar objects, glasses/hearing aids, minimize restraints, lights on during day/off at night"
      - "Medications (LAST resort): Haloperidol 0.5-1mg PO/IM (hyperactive only), avoid benzos (worsen), avoid if possible"
      - "Disposition: Admit if cannot identify/treat cause outpatient, high fall risk, unable to care for self at home"
    icd10:
      - R41.0     # Disorientation, unspecified

  - id: GER-FALLS
    label: Recurrent Falls (Geriatric Syndrome)
    presentations:
      - Two or more falls in past 12 months, or 1 fall with injury requiring medical attention
      - Gait instability: Shuffling, wide-based, slow speed, difficulty turning
      - Balance impairment: Unable to tandem walk, Romberg positive, difficulty with chair rises
      - Fear of falling (FOF): Limits activities, social isolation, deconditioning
      - Intrinsic risk factors: Age >80, prior falls, muscle weakness, vision impairment, cognitive impairment
      - Extrinsic risk factors: Polypharmacy (>4 meds), environmental hazards (rugs, poor lighting)
      - May result in fractures (hip, wrist), head injury, inability to get up ("long lie")
    clinical_pearls:
      - "Fall assessment: Ask ALL patients >65: 'Have you fallen in the past year?'"
      - "Get Up and Go test: Time patient standing from chair, walking 10 feet, turning, walking back, sitting - >12 sec = high risk"
      - "High-risk medications: Sedatives (benzos, antihistamines), antihypertensives, psychotropics"
      - "Multifactorial intervention: Exercise (strength + balance), medication review, vision correction, home safety"
      - "Vitamin D 800-1000 IU daily: Reduces falls by 20% in elderly"
      - "Hip protectors: Consider for nursing home residents with high fall risk"
    management:
      - "History: Circumstances of fall, loss of consciousness, prodrome, injuries, witnesses"
      - "Physical exam: Orthostatic vitals, vision screen, gait/balance testing, neurologic exam, foot exam"
      - "Labs: CBC (anemia), BMP (dehydration), vitamin D, consider ECG/Holter if syncope suspected"
      - "Interventions: PT/OT referral (strengthening, balance, assistive device), medication review (stop/reduce high-risk meds), vision correction, home safety evaluation"
      - "Disposition: Admit if fall with injury, syncope, unable to mobilize safely; outpatient if low-risk with close follow-up"

  - id: GER-POLYPHARMACY
    label: Polypharmacy and Adverse Drug Reactions
    presentations:

      - Adverse drug events (ADEs): Falls, delirium, GI bleed, renal injury
      - Anticholinergic burden: Cumulative anticholinergic effects (dry mouth, constipation, urinary retention, confusion)
    clinical_pearls:
      - "Beers Criteria = PIMs to avoid in elderly: Anticholinergics (diphenhydramine, hydroxyzine), benzos, NSAIDs, PPIs long-term, sliding scale insulin"
      - "STOPP/START: STOPP = potentially inappropriate meds to stop, START = beneficial meds to start"
      - "Deprescribing: Systematically reduce/stop meds, prioritize those causing ADEs or no clear benefit"
      - "Anticholinergic burden scale: Each anticholinergic med increases fall/delirium risk cumulatively"
      - "Medication reconciliation at EVERY visit: Brown bag review (bring all meds/supplements)"
      - "Start low, go slow: Elderly more sensitive to medications (reduced renal clearance, altered pharmacodynamics)"
    management:
      - "Comprehensive medication review: List all prescriptions, OTC, supplements, herbals"
      - "Identify PIMs: Use Beers criteria or STOPP/START, flag anticholinergics, sedatives, high-risk meds"
      - "Deprescribing plan: Stop 1 med at a time, taper if needed (benzos, opioids, PPIs), monitor for withdrawal/rebound"
      - "Simplify regimen: Once-daily dosing preferred, pill organizers, medication list with indications"
      - "Disposition: Outpatient management with close follow-up, pharmacist consult, geriatrician referral if complex"
