  - id: TOX-ACETAMINOPHEN-OD
    label: Acetaminophen (Tylenol) Overdose
    presentations:
      - Stage 1 (0-24h): Nausea, vomiting, malaise, or asymptomatic (most common presentation)
      - Stage 2 (24-72h): RUQ pain, rising AST/ALT (>1000), elevated INR
      - Stage 3 (72-96h): Hepatic failure (peak transaminases), jaundice, coagulopathy, encephalopathy, lactic acidosis
      - Stage 4 (4 days-2 weeks): Recovery or death from liver failure
      - Toxic dose: >150 mg/kg (child) or >7.5g total (adult) in single acute ingestion
      - Chronic toxicity: >4g/day for several days (alcoholics, malnourished at higher risk)
      - Many patients asymptomatic initially despite lethal dose
    clinical_pearls:
      - "4-hour acetaminophen level: Plot on Rumack-Matthew nomogram to determine treatment need"
      - "NAC (N-acetylcysteine) = antidote: Most effective if started <8hr, but give up to 24hr or beyond if elevated AST/ALT"
      - "NAC dosing: 150 mg/kg IV load over 1hr, then 50 mg/kg over 4hr, then 100 mg/kg over 16hr (total 21hr protocol)"
      - "Oral NAC alternative: 140 mg/kg load, then 70 mg/kg q4h ×17 doses (can use if IV unavailable)"
      - "If level >150 mcg/mL at 4hr or >75 at 8hr or >35 at 12hr → treatment line, give NAC"
      - "Check AST/ALT, INR: If elevated despite NAC, continue NAC until transaminases downtrending and INR <2"
    management:
      - "Immediate: Acetaminophen level at 4hr post-ingestion (earlier levels unreliable), AST/ALT, INR, consider activated charcoal if <1hr"
      - "Plot level on Rumack-Matthew nomogram: If above treatment line or unknown time, start NAC"
      - "NAC IV protocol: 150 mg/kg in 200mL D5W over 1hr, then 50 mg/kg in 500mL over 4hr, then 100 mg/kg in 1L over 16hr"
      - "Monitor: Serial AST/ALT, INR q12-24h, continue NAC if transaminases rising or INR elevated"
      - "Disposition: Admit if NAC needed, psychiatry consult if intentional, liver transplant evaluation if fulminant hepatic failure"

  - id: TOX-SALICYLATE
    label: Salicylate Toxicity (Aspirin Overdose)
    presentations:
      - Tinnitus, hearing loss (earliest symptoms, occur at therapeutic levels 20-30 mg/dL)
      - Nausea, vomiting, epigastric pain
      - Tachypnea, hyperpnea (respiratory alkalosis from direct medullary stimulation)
      - Altered mental status, confusion, agitation, lethargy
      - Fever, diaphoresis (uncouples oxidative phosphorylation)
      - Mixed acid-base disorder: Respiratory alkalosis (early) + metabolic acidosis (late, severe)
      - Chronic toxicity: Elderly, subtle symptoms, higher mortality
      - Toxic level: >30 mg/dL (acute), >20 mg/dL (chronic)
    clinical_pearls:
      - "Mixed acid-base disorder = hallmark: Respiratory alkalosis + anion gap metabolic acidosis"
      - "Urine alkalinization (pH 7.5-8): Traps ionized salicylate in urine, increases renal clearance"
      - "Hemodialysis indications: Level >100 mg/dL, severe acidosis (pH <7.2), altered mental status, pulmonary edema, renal failure"
      - "Chronic toxicity more dangerous: Lower levels cause more toxicity (>20 mg/dL), often missed diagnosis"
      - "Do NOT give aspirin-containing products for symptom relief (obviously)"
      - "Check serial levels q2-4h: Delayed absorption with enteric-coated or sustained-release formulations"
    management:
      - "Immediate: Salicylate level, VBG (pH), BMP (anion gap), glucose, activated charcoal if <1hr, consider whole bowel irrigation if sustained-release"
      - "Urine alkalinization: 3 amps (150 mEq) NaHCO3 in 1L D5W at 150-250 mL/hr, target urine pH 7.5-8"
      - "Avoid intubation if possible: Hypoventilation worsens acidosis and increases CNS salicylate"
      - "Hemodialysis: If level >100, pH <7.2, altered mental status, pulmonary edema, or refractory despite alkalinization"
      - "Disposition: ICU if severe (level >80, acidosis, altered MS), nephrology for dialysis, serial levels until downtrending"

      - Miosis: Pinpoint pupils (classic triad with CNS depression and respiratory depression)
      - Bradycardia, hypotension
      - Cyanosis, hypoxia (SpO2 <90%)
      - Track marks, nasal insufflation evidence, or drug paraphernalia
      - Responds dramatically to naloxone (diagnostic and therapeutic)
      - Risk factors: Fentanyl (very potent), polypharmacy (benzos + opioids), resuming use after abstinence
    clinical_pearls:
      - "Airway management FIRST: Bag-valve-mask ventilation more important than naloxone initially"
      - "Naloxone dosing: 0.04-0.4mg IV/IM/IN, repeat q2-3min (max 10mg), titrate to respiratory effort NOT full consciousness"
      - "Goal: Adequate respirations (RR >10), NOT full alertness (avoid precipitating severe withdrawal)"
      - "Fentanyl: May need higher/repeat naloxone doses (very potent, long-acting)"
      - "Observe 4-6 hours: Naloxone half-life shorter than most opioids, re-sedation common"
      - "Naloxone drip: If repeated boluses needed, 2/3 of total reversal dose per hour IV infusion"
    management:
      - "Immediate: Airway (bag-valve-mask if apneic), naloxone 0.4mg IV/IM/intranasal, repeat q2-3min PRN"
      - "Titrate naloxone: Goal RR >10, adequate ventilation (not full alertness - avoid withdrawal)"
      - "If IV access difficult: Intranasal naloxone 2-4mg (Narcan spray) or IM 0.4-2mg"
      - "Continuous monitoring: Pulse ox, cardiac monitor, serial neuro exams"
      - "Disposition: Observe 4-6hr minimum (re-sedation risk), naloxone drip if recurrent, psychiatry if intentional, addiction resources"

      - Onset: Typically within 24 hours of medication change
      - Hunter Criteria: More sensitive than Sternbach criteria for diagnosis
    clinical_pearls:
      - "Hunter Criteria (requires serotonergic agent + one of): Spontaneous clonus, inducible clonus + agitation/diaphoresis, ocular clonus + agitation/diaphoresis, tremor + hyperreflexia, hypertonia + temp >38 + ocular clonus/inducible clonus"
      - "Clonus = KEY finding: Inducible ankle clonus most specific, test by rapid dorsiflexion"
      - "Differentiate from NMS: SS = hyperreflexia/clonus, NMS = hyporeflexia/lead-pipe rigidity"
      - "Stop offending agents immediately: Improvement typically within 24 hours"
      - "Cyproheptadine (5-HT2A antagonist): 12mg load, then 8mg q6h (max 32mg/day)"

      - CNS: Altered mental status, agitation → sedation → seizures → coma

      - Rapid deterioration: Can go from awake to arrest in minutes
    clinical_pearls:
      - "QRS >100ms = HIGH RISK for arrhythmias and seizures, requires sodium bicarbonate"

      - "Sodium bicarbonate = FIRST-LINE for cardiac toxicity: Give for QRS >100ms or arrhythmias"
      - "NaHCO3 mechanism: Overcomes sodium channel blockade (alkalinization + sodium loading)"
      - "Avoid Class Ia/Ic antiarrhythmics: Worsen sodium channel blockade (procainamide, quinidine)"
      - "Seizures: Benzodiazepines first-line, avoid phenytoin (also blocks sodium channels)"
    management:
      - "Immediate: Continuous cardiac monitoring, IV access, 12-lead ECG (look for QRS >100ms, terminal R in aVR)"
