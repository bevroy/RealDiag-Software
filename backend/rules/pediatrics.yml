      - Westley Croup Score: 0-17 (stridor, retractions, air entry, cyanosis, LOC)
    clinical_pearls:
      - "Westley score <3 = mild (treat outpatient), 3-7 = moderate, ≥8 = severe (hospitalize)"
      - "Dexamethasone 0.6mg/kg PO/IM (max 10mg) = mainstay treatment, single dose usually sufficient"
      - "Racemic epinephrine nebulizer 0.5mL in 3mL NS for severe croup (provides 2hr relief)"
      - "Cool mist therapy or taking child outside in cold air may provide symptomatic relief"
      - "Steeple sign on neck X-ray: Subglottic narrowing (but diagnosis is clinical, don't need X-ray)"
      - "Most improve within 48 hours, but can worsen at night"
    management:
      - "All patients: Dexamethasone 0.6mg/kg PO or IM (max 10mg), single dose"
      - "Mild croup (no stridor at rest): Dexamethasone and discharge with precautions"
      - "Moderate-severe (stridor at rest): Racemic epinephrine 0.5mL (2.25%) + 3mL NS nebulizer"
      - "Observe 2-3 hours after epinephrine: Rebound stridor can occur, may need repeat dosing"
