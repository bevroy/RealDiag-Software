      - CT: Dilated small bowel >3cm with transition point, air-fluid levels on X-ray
    clinical_pearls:
      - "Adhesions = most common cause (60%), especially if prior abdominal surgery"
      - "Complete vs partial: Complete SBO (no gas in colon), partial (some gas passes through)"
      - "CT findings: Transition point, small bowel feces sign, closed-loop obstruction (surgical emergency)"
      - "NGT decompression: Decreases vomiting, aspiration risk, helps conservative management"
      - "Surgery indications: Strangulation signs (fever, tachycardia, leukocytosis, peritonitis), closed-loop, no improvement 3-5 days"
      - "Virgin abdomen (no prior surgery) SBO = more likely needs surgery (hernia, malignancy)"
    management:
      - "Immediate: NPO, NGT decompression (continuous suction), IV fluids (NS or LR 100-200 mL/hr)"
      - "Labs: CBC (leukocytosis = strangulation), BMP (check K+ from vomiting), lactate (ischemia)"
      - "CT abdomen/pelvis with IV contrast: Identify transition point, rule out ischemia/strangulation"
      - "Conservative management: NGT, IV fluids, serial exams if partial SBO and no strangulation signs"

    clinical_pearls:

      - "Pulselessness = LATE finding: Irreversible damage already occurred, do NOT wait for this"
      - "Compartment pressure measurement: >30 mmHg or Δ30 mmHg of diastolic BP = fasciotomy indicated"
      - "Clinical diagnosis: Don't delay for pressure measurement if high suspicion"

      - "Compartment pressure measurement: Stryker device or arterial line setup, measure affected compartments"
      - "If pressure >30 mmHg or Δ30 mmHg below diastolic BP: EMERGENT fasciotomy"
      - "Orthopedic/surgery consult immediately: Fasciotomy = surgical decompression of all compartments"

      - Mortality: 50% prehospital, 80-90% overall if untreated
    clinical_pearls:
      - "Unstable patient (SBP <90) with known AAA or pulsatile mass: Go straight to OR, do NOT get CT"
      - "Permissive hypotension: Target SBP 80-100 until proximal control (avoid 'pop the clot')"
      - "FAST exam: Free intraperitoneal or retroperitoneal fluid + hypotension = presumed rAAA"
      - "CT angiogram if stable: Confirms diagnosis, guides EVAR vs open repair"
      - "EVAR (endovascular repair): Faster, less invasive if anatomy suitable"
      - "Open repair: Midline laparotomy, proximal aortic control, higher mortality but definitive"
    management:
      - "Immediate: Large-bore IV access ×2, permissive hypotension (SBP 80-100), activate massive transfusion protocol"
      - "UNSTABLE: Call vascular surgery, go directly to OR, do NOT delay for imaging"
      - "STABLE: CT angiogram abdomen/pelvis, vascular surgery consult, determine EVAR vs open"
      - "Blood products: 1:1:1 ratio PRBC:FFP:Platelets, avoid crystalloid overresuscitation"
