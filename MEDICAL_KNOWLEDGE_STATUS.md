## Conclusion

RealDiag now contains **215 diagnoses across 13 disease families** with **9 comprehensive decision trees** and **intelligent symptom-based search**, transforming it from a passive reference tool into an active diagnostic assistant.

**Key Strengths:**
- Comprehensive specialty coverage (13 families)
- Decision trees for most common emergency/urgent presentations
- Symptom-based diagnostic suggestions with match scoring
- Standardized data structure
- Clinical presentation focus
- Coding standards compliance (ICD-10 + SNOMED)
- Extensible architecture

**Recent Additions (November 2025):**
✨ 5 new decision trees (chest pain, abdominal pain, dyspnea, fever, syncope)
✨ 2 new disease families (hematology/oncology, orthopedics)
✨ Symptom-based search algorithm with intelligent ranking
✨ 38 new diagnoses added (177 → 215)

**Priorities for Growth:**
1. Add remaining major specialties (Ophthalmology, ENT, Urology)
2. Expand decision trees (altered mental status, trauma, joint pain)
3. Clinical validation and guideline integration
4. Risk calculators (CHADS2-VASc, Wells score, TIMI, CURB-65)
5. Treatment protocols and medication information

The system has reached a critical milestone: it now provides active diagnostic assistance for the majority of common clinical presentations, not just reference data. With 215 diagnoses, 9 decision trees, and intelligent symptom-based search, RealDiag is positioned to serve as a comprehensive clinical decision support tool.
